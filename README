# Sheet Habit Tracker

This is a template + script to generate habit tracker sheets in SVG.

## Instructions
- Clone this repo
- Run `main.py` and follow instructions
- Open the resulting SVG file and print it

## How it works?
The script will copy and fill in the relevant elements from template files with data from `data.json`. If `data.json` is not found, it will be created automatically.

I recommend using Inkscape if you need to modify the template drawing.
